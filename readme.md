# Jérôme plays with AI ideas

This repo started with me trying out the [Hugging Face NLP courser](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/3). As always, things quickly started
to grow and deserved being managed in a repo.

Don't expect anything particularly dependable here, this is just me toying 
around. If you end up looking at this repo, it's probably more that I'm needing help from you rather than the other way round...
