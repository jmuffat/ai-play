        America has changed dramatically during recent years. Not only has the number of 
        graduates in traditional engineering disciplines such as mechanical, civil, 
        electrical, chemical, and aeronautical engineering declined, but in most of 
        the premier American universities engineering curricula now concentrate on 
        and encourage largely the study of engineering science. As a result, there 
        are declining offerings in engineering subjects dealing with infrastructure, 
        the environment, and related issues, and greater concentration on high 
        technology subjects, largely supporting increasingly complex scientific 
        developments. While the latter is important, it should not be at the expense 
        of more traditional engineering.

        Rapidly developing economies such as China and India, as well as other 
        industrial countries in Europe and Asia, continue to encourage and advance 
        the teaching of engineering. Both China and India, respectively, graduate 
        six and eight times as many traditional engineers as does the United States. 
        Other industrial countries at minimum maintain their output, while America 
        suffers an increasingly serious decline in the number of engineering graduates 
        and a lack of well-educated engineers.

        "Computers don’t process information in the same way as humans. For example, when we read the sentence “I am hungry,” we can easily understand its meaning. Similarly, given two sentences such as “I am hungry” and “I am sad,” we’re able to easily determine how similar they are. For machine learning (ML) models, such tasks are more difficult. The text needs to be processed in a way that enables the model to learn from it. And because language is complex, we need to think carefully about how this processing must be done. There has been a lot of research done on how to represent text, and we will look at some methods in the next chapter."
